# Team Events

#### Overview

We aim to have a team event once a month. There are two kinds, each of which happen every second month:

1. Casual Fun.
  - By default we go to the local pub on the second Thursday of the month.
  - (Though the date and activity are flexible if someone wants to suggest alternatives, like a board game evening.)
1. Organised Fun.
  - These are more creative events that require planning. Previous examples include playing Kegelbahn, a BBQ on the roof terrace, an escape game and a Berliner Unterwelten tour.
  - Organising these events is a single team's responsibility. That means: picking an activity, confirming funding with our CTO, deciding on an appropriate day (for instance with a Doodle) and handling the logistics.
  - Our [development teams](https://github.com/liefery/don-t-panic/wiki/Teams), plus the Product Team and IT-Infrastructure, take it in turns to organise something.

[Here is the list of upcoming team events for 2019-20](https://github.com/liefery/don-t-panic/wiki/Team-Event-Organisation-Rota), along with the team responsible for organising each month.
