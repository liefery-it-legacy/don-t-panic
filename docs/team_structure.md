# Team structure

The IT team (department) is managed by the CTO and split into a few
[sub-teams](https://github.com/liefery/don-t-panic/wiki/Teams). Every team is
managed by a team lead and the team leads report to the CTO. All people who are
not part of a team report directly to the CTO. The CTO is ultimately
responsible for "everything IT at Liefery", but they delegate most of these
responsibilities down to team leads and individual team members.

The teams are grouped around the team lead and the extra responsibilities
assigned to every team.
Team members don't necessarily work together all the time, because of our
[squad approach](../Readme.md#squad). In fact, it's desirable that we shuffle
squads every season and form them from different teams for the purpose of
knowledge sharing and to avoid creating different cultures in different teams.

## Extra areas of expertise

Every team has a few areas of expertise / responsibility assigned to them.
These are the tasks that don't fit in our squad-based approach to developing
software (owning infrastructure, performance monitoring), and topics for
knowledge sharing. The team is free to distribute these responsibilities among
them, as they see fit. The person ultimately responsible for the effects is the
team lead.

## Team lead

"Team lead" is a job position that comes with the responsibility of managing
other people. A team lead is responsible for:
- running regular 1-on-1's and acting on the issues mentioned
- helping with career progression and professional development
- collecting and delivering feedback
- mediating in technical discussions (we explicitly don't want a team lead to
  have a deciding voice in technical discussions)
- extra areas of expertise assigned to their team
- hiring
- approving holiday, remote work and sickness requests in HeavenHR
- keeping track of the conference budget for their team
