# Decision Meetings

For decisions that are too complex or controversial to make quickly in the
context of squad work, retros, or other meetings, we use a process from the
Holacracy approach of decentralized management and governance of organizations.

The idea is to combine discussion and decision in one structured process,
starting with a concrete proposal by someone who feels a tension and based on
it a need for improvement.

The proposer provides a **short** summary in the wiki (start
[here](https://github.com/liefery/don-t-panic/wiki/Decisions)), that people can
use to prepare and add questions to. Aim for 2 minutes reading time - not more,
so people can prepare quickly and it is likely that they will :) ).
=> [These notes](https://github.com/liefery/don-t-panic/wiki/2020_03_16-new-meeting-process)
can be used as a template.

The core meeting process structure looks like this:

- Proposal*

- Clarifying questions

- Reaction round

- Optional: clarify or/and modify proposal

- Objection round

- Integration


There is a facilitator for the process and a note-taker.


Objections are considered valid if they show how the proposal is NOT

- good enough for now

- safe enough to try


If necessary, the decision can later be adjusted via the same process.



\* If the person with the need for the improvement doesnâ€™t have a proposal yet,
the team can assist at this point.
