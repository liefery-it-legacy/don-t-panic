# Internships

Internships at Liefery Engineering are paid, full-time and are scheduled in
3-months time increments.

## Interview

When interviewing for an internship we:
- focus on non-coding skills
- usually skip the coding exercise
- look for positive attitude and learning potential

## Internship mentor

Every intership has a designated internship mentor. The internship mentor is
responsible for:
- initial onboarding
- helping with organisational issues
- being a stable point of contact for the intern
- making sure that the intern has tasks to work on
- initial help with coding and the codebase

The expected workload of an internship mentor is 2 hours per day on average
(more at the beginning of the internship, less at the end of the internship).
As the internship progresses and the intern gets more comfortable with working
with other team members, the mentoring should be spread over multiple people to
provide a diverse perspective of working in our team.

## Initial internship project

We start the internship with a separate internship project. It is typically:
- independent from the main application
- a separate, new application
- non-time-critical from the business point of view
- a tool to increase the productivity of our team

## Check-ins and feedback

We make an initial check-in after the first two weeks of the internship to make
sure that the onboarding went smoothly and the internship goals are clear.

In the middle of the internship (after 1.5 month) we provide feedback, state
our expectations and discuss the possible next steps after the internship is
over.

At the end of the internship we provide final feedback and decide how to
proceed with the employment. The possibile outcomes may be:
- hire as a full-time junior developer
- hire as a part-time working student
- prolong the internship by another 3 months
- end the cooperation
