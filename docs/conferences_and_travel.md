## Conferences and travel

We want to encourage everyone on the team to learn and share their knowledge. As
part of that we encourage everyone to attend conferences about things your work
benefits from and then tell others on the team about it.

### Applying to go to a conference

If you would like to go to a conference, pick your event, make a travel plan
that includes all cost including conference ticket, travel and accomodation and
submit it to Christian (or Jan if Christian is on vacation). When approved, you can
book your tickets and submit an expense claim. Josi can help with creating the
claim.

If the cost of the conference is substantial we can ask our finance department
to do the booking to avoid advancing the cost. To be nice to them and not treat
them as travel agents, please prefer advancing the cost or parking it on a
credit card if possible.

### Speaking engagements

By getting accepted as a speaker you can overdraw your conference budget by
25%, meaning that the total cost for non-speaking conferences has to be within
your conference budget and the total cost including speaking engagements can be
up to 125% of your conference budget. Given that speaking engagements are often
subsidized by the conference this will allow you to attend quite a bit more
conferences if you get a talk accepted.

### Travel cost reimbursement

When booking flights or hotel rooms we should try to stay in these limits
* 150 EUR for a flight
* 85 EUR per night for a hotel


The travel expenses must meet the following formal criteria, otherwise there might be
trouble getting them reimbursed:
* there must be an invoice or receipt for every cost (credit card slips don't
  count as invoices)
* any invoice / receipt over 150 EUR (net) has to be addressed to the company using the full company address:
```
LieferFactory GmbH
Brunnenstra√üe 128
13355 Berlin
```
* The previous point is especially important when booking flights. It's best to
  specify the invoice address during booking. The alternative is to call the
  customer support of the airline to issue a new invoice but this might take some
  time.


To get reimbursed for your bookings, fill out the "Vorlage Reisenkostensabrechnung" excel sheet. If you don't have this sheet, please ask a team member to email it to you. You don't need to fill in costs referring to meals etc... as these are automatically handled with a daily allowance. You will get this money back even if you don't spend the full allowed amount (the amount varies based on where you go). Feel free to ask for help when you need it :)

Please fill out and hand in an expense sheet as your expense occurs per calendar month. For example: if you buy a conference ticket in January, submit an expense sheet in January. If you then buy your train ticket in February, submit a separate expense sheet in February.

Once you have filled out the form, print it off, sign it, and give it to Christian to sign, along with your invoices. Your money should be reimbursed shortly :moneybag:


### Conferences days, workshops, travel, weekends and holidays

Attending a conference on a regular work day is considered a normal work day.
If a conference day falls on a weekend or a holiday, we can take one half-day
off for each lost holiday/Saturday/Sunday, as compensation.

When traveling for the company the travel time is also work time. This means we
should also try to do work on the road (as the travel schedule permits).

If you take part in weekend workshops (e.g. CodeCurious coaching) with a chance
to promote Liefery as an employer, you can also take half of the workshop time
as time off.
