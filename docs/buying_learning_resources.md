# Buying learning resources

Everyone on the team is highly encouraged to buy learning resources that can
help them in their work and professional development. This includes books
(preferably e-books), screencasts, and other online materials.

When you find a paid resource that you want to buy, please contact one of:
- Christian
- [Team leads](https://github.com/liefery/don-t-panic/wiki/Teams)

They will authorize the purchase and forward the request to the person who has
access to the company credit card, in a way that makes our finance department
happy.
