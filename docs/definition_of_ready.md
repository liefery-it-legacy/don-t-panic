# Definition of Ready

The things we should know before pulling a ticket into the sprint; to catch problems early and avoid wasted or duplicate coding effort.

### Valuable
We know the business value of the ticket.  
We know that it is still useful.  
<sub>*Do we need to do this ticket at all?*  </sub>  

### Product & Technical
We have thought about the best overall solution 
and not just the specific solution requested by ops.

### Tech design
We have discussed the technical design if it is a large/complex feature ticket.

### Size
We have broken down the ticket if it is large.  

### Acceptance criteria
We have enough details to know when the feature is finished.  
The task is concrete and not vague like "improve x".
