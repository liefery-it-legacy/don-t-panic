# Vacations

## Communicating your absence

When going on vacation, colleagues from other departments or external contacts might try to reach out to us or schedule meetings with us. To make sure they are automatically informed about absences we need to set up the following 2 things before going on vacations. These steps are optional for everyone who does not normally communicate outside of the IT team, but are mandatory for team leads, the QA and product management team as well as anyone involved in a hiring team.

### 1. Email autoresponder
The autoresponder can be set up in the menu bar of Outlook for Mac unter _Tools_ -> _Out of Office_. There you can set up from when to when the auto responder should be active and 2 email texts that any person writing you an email should receive. One text is for colleagues within our organizaion (@liefery.com) and one for external people. Make sure to include the day of your return and a name and email address of a colleague people can contact instead of you in both texts.


### 2. Multi-day Calendar event for your absence
In your @liefery.com calender, add a multi-day all-day event for the time of your absence to prevent other people from scheduling meetings with you during this time.
